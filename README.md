Nested loops

Program to calculate the average grade of our user.  
user will be entering 3 grades. We use i+1 in the do  
loop because we're asking the user to enter the  
grades starting with 1, not grade zero.  
The do while makes sure that the user enters  
a valid grade. It must be between 1 and 5.  
It keeps looping on the same grade if the user  
entered a grade of say 9, or 6.
